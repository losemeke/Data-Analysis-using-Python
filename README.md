# IBM DATA ANALYST CERTIFICATION PROJECTS
These are the data wrangling and cleaning projects I worked on via IBM's Data Analyst Certification Program. I worked with various datasets and performed different wrangling and cleaning methods and composed queries on Jupyter Notebook. I also have webscraping and API projects. All the Capstone project materials have been titled as such and its the only project where I put my findings on a dashboard. Please feel free to check them out
