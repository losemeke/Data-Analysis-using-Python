# IBM DATA ANALYST CERTIFICATION PROJECTS

I worked with various datasets and performed different wrangling and cleaning methods and composed queries on Jupyter Notebook. All the Capstone project materials have been titled as such and its the only project where I put my findings on slides. Please feel free to check them out
